    content: |-
      I’m a data engineer and web developer with a background in economics and public policy. I build data-driven web 
      applications that turn messy, real-world data into reliable systems and usable tools. My work focuses on designing 
      scalable ETL pipelines, APIs, and dashboards using modern data and web technologies, often in public-sector and 
      civic-tech contexts where data quality, transparency, and real-world constraints matter.

      I am currently working on OpenPerú, a civic-tech platform that uses unstructured public legislative data to make 
      voting records, bills, and party dynamics more transparent and accessible.
